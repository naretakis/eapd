The **product owners** set our vision and goals, help the team get around blockers, and keep the team on course to deliver value.

The **product manager** helps the product owners set clear goals, navigates internal blockers, and helps the product owners ensure that the team is on course. In many ways, the product owners fill a lot of the traditional product management role and the product manager helps them do that.

The **UX designers** help define the behavior of the product and shape the use of language in the product in order to make it as understandable, usable, and useful as possible. The design team does primary research, UI and UX explorations, and usability testing, as well as helping inform the strategy of the product.

The **developers** write the actual code that powers the product. Normally, the **front end developer** is responsible for building the parts of the website that people directly interact with, while the **back end developer** works on the machinery under the hood. However, some developers have both front end and back end skills (they are **full stack developers**), which leads to a less black and white division of labor.

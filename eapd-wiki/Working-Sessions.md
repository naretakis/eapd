The team dedicates a block of time every week to review current issues, co-work, project plan, and anything else that needs to be done without the need to schedule around people's calendars. These weekly sessions don't remove the ad-hoc meetings needed to keep the project moving forward, but serve to augment the team's availability.

The agenda for the upcoming meeting is maintained below and is updated throughout the week.

When adding items to the agenda, please include the time / length of the meeting, the intent of the meeting, and the intended audience. If there are any overlaps, please coordinate the timing through standup or our Slack channel.

1) 1:00 PM - 1:15 PM: Backlog Refinement[Design, Project/Product, and Development]

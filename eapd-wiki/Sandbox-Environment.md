## Welcome to the eAPD Sandbox environment!
This is a test/development environment, it's purpose is to give States interested in the eAPD system an opportunity to use and familiarize themselves with the system before diving into the Production site. Because this is a test/development environment no real data is allowed in the test/development site, and all data stored in the Sandbox environment will be periodically wiped out. 

### FAQs
1. What is the eAPD Sandbox environment?
The eAPD Sandbox environment is the eAPDs teams Staging environment. We use our Staging environment to test upcoming features and changes to the eAPD Application before they are released into Production. New features and changes are first tested in a Preview environment so the Sandbox/Staging environment should be mostly stable, but it is very much still a non-Production system.

2. How do I get access to the eAPD Sandbox environment?
You need to create an account here, https://impl.reg.idm.cms.gov/registration.html?appid=eapd. Once you have the account, go to http://staging-eapd.cms.gov and log in. This will walk you through the process of requesting access to eAPD. However, the request still requires manual review and so is therefore, not instant access.

3. How often does the Sandbox environment get reset?
The Sandbox environment receives updates multiple times a day, however this process incurs 0 downtime and should be seamless. This is however still a development environment, so there is a chance that an update will temporarily break the Sandbox environment. In most cases this will not require the data within the eAPD Sandbox environment to be reset. Our data reset cadence is once every 60 days or as needed development purposes, which is rare.

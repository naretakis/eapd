# On-Call Policy - DRAFT
When a potential incident is reported either via a user or through an alarm/alerting mechanism the on-call person will need to assess the situation. If the on-call confirms an incident they will need to determine what kind of incident, Availability or Security, and if the incident needs to be addressed immediately or if it can wait for business hours. When the incident is being worked on-call will need to contact an incident commander. The incident commander will ideally be either the Primary or Secondary On-call person. In some cases additional personnel will be needed due to expertise.

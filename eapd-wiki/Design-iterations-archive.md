Welcome to our time capsule! Throughout the life of this project, we have taken snapshots every so often to capture the progression of the design. Here are the major iterations of the app over time â€” it's come a long way! 
 
# APD process before the project started
All of the content was authored in Word Documents and relied on change tracking and highlighting updates. The APD format consisted mainly of long blocks of content and in-line tables.

# January 2021
No major overall design changes. The focus has been on accessibility improvements, content consistency, smaller refinements based on user research, like reorganizing some pages in the navigation, changing the navigation labels to increase understanding, and updating fields and help text with in the app to get the right information that needs to be collected. A bigger design update is forthcoming in 2021!

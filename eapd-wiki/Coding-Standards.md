# Naming standards
### Branches
When naming your branch, start with indicating who wrote it. Most developers will use the first letter of their first name and their last name (e.g. Another Developer becomes adeveloper). If your last name is long or complicated you can abbreviate to your initials. Then indicate the ticket number the branch is for. Lastly, add a short kebab case description of the ticket.
```
adeveloper/101-coding-standards
```

### PRs
When naming a PR, start with the ticket number, so that it's easier to find, then add the full ticket name

# Production

Production refers to the version of the product that is open for business. It lives at [eapd.cms.gov](https://eapd.cms.gov). For states that want to use eAPD, please contact your State Officer for more information. Note that the production product is not yet available for all states to use.

# Staging

Staging is the version of the app currently in development. It contains all the upcoming features just before they're released to production. This is a good chance for the product team and our partners to test out the new features and bug fixes before pushing them out for states to use.

To access the staging site, you will need credentials created and provided by the eAPD Product Owner. Next, visit the staging domain at [staging-eapd.cms.gov](https://staging-eapd.cms.gov) and log in with the credentials provided by the eAPD Product Owner.
